# Python Electronic Circuit Solver (PYECS)
### built by Julien Audet (for now)
### for Electricity and Magnetism ; 203-NYB-05
This project is an electronic circuit solver made for my final project of my electricity class.
It takes as input a circuit containing only resistors and batteries, where all the resistors' resistances and the batteries' voltages are known.
It can display that circuit, solve it or save it for later use.

It is designed so that the average electricity student can quickly learn to use it efficiently. This can allow students to verify some answers by themselves, without requiring teacher assistance, thus saving an enormous ammoutn of time.

## usage: 
To use it, Python must be installed on the computer. (for newcomers, check the "add to PATH" checkbox in "advanced settings" while you install Python). The following libraries must also be installed (a quick google will tell you how to do so)

Matplotlib  
Numpy     
Pandas   
Networkx  

## mini tutorial:
first download the repository into a single folder. Then, open a terminal window at that location (shift+Rclick, "new powershell"). Type "python pyecs.py".
This should open the PYECS CLI (command line interface). Type "help" and enter. You are now in the help menu. Read it to get a basic understanding. You can now try to build a graph via GUI, solve it, and display the information.
