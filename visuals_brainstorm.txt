could add CLI commands

first things first lets get a csv graph reader... right?


    
then node selection from case double-click (or click and drag?)
    coupled with GUI prompting type and value (resistance or voltage, depending on type)
    builds graph or csv?
    could add : graph to csv and solve the problem (can then save graphs for reuse)
