Hi! Welcome to the PYECS software. This is the help guide. 
The full text is available in the "help.txt" file
The following commands are organized by indent: you can type the fist level commands, and will be prompted for further information
here's a quick tour of the commands you can use:

    help   (this is the current command, it shows the help document)

    quit (to quit the program)

    build (type this to load a graph into memory. You will be prompted for information:)
        csv <filename> (to input a graph from csv, you must enter a valid filename of a csv table in the "graphs" folder)
        gui (this will popup the GUI graph building interface)
            click and drag to add components, you will be prompted for their information in the terminal
            it only accepts batteries and resistances.
            For type, write either:  "resistance" or "r" for resistance; "battery" or "b" for batteries

    
    show (type this to display information about a graph loaded in memory. You will be prompted for information)
            (polarity is for the code, flow is the node from which current flows, into the other one)
        full (this shows the full list of edge pairs (so double the actual edges). It's useful when you want to verify edges connecting to a specific node)
        plot (this shows the graph in matplotlib, BUT WILL GIVE AN ERROR if you try to input a graph that was not made from the GUI)

    solve (type this to solve a currently loaded graph)
        your currently loaded graph will become the solved version, unless an error occurs

    save (type this to save a currently loaded graph)
        you will be prompted for the name under which you want to save your file
        it will be saved under the "graphs" folder
